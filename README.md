Project Description: Analysis of Food Product Sales Using Pivot Tables and Charts
This project involves an analysis of food product sales data in German cities from 2021 to 2022. The data includes information on the sale date, customers, city, region, product categories, specific products, unit price, quantity sold, and profit.

Project Objectives:
Sales Analysis by Region and City: Identifying the most profitable regions and cities with the highest sales volumes.
Sales Analysis by Product Categories: Determining the most popular product categories and their contribution to overall profit.
Sales Analysis by Specific Products: Identifying the top 5 best-selling products and their profitability.
Sales Analysis by Customers: Identifying key customers who generate the most profit.
Quarterly Sales Analysis: Determining the quarters with the highest and lowest sales.
Data Visualization: Creating charts, graphs, and slices for clear visualization of the analysis results.

Main Stages of the Project:
Data Collection and Preparation: Data was collected into an Excel table, where each row represents a separate sales transaction. The data was checked for errors and inconsistencies.
Creating Pivot Tables: Pivot tables were created to quickly aggregate data based on various parameters.
Data Analysis: Based on the pivot tables, analyses were conducted to determine key sales performance indicators.
Visualization of Results: Charts and graphs were created to clearly interpret the analysis results.

Key Findings:
Regions: The most profitable regions are the East and North, where the highest sales volumes are observed.
Product Categories: The most popular categories are beverages, oils, and cheeses, which contribute significantly to profit.
Products: The top 5 best-selling products are coffee, Gouda cheese, butter, oil, and rice.
Customers: The key customers generating the most profit are "Cooking Corner," "Mymeal," and "FoodBite."

Use of Results:
The analysis results can be used to make strategic decisions regarding product range expansion, logistics optimization, and marketing campaigns targeting key regions and customers.
This project demonstrates how pivot tables and charts can be effectively used to analyze large volumes of data and make informed business decisions.
